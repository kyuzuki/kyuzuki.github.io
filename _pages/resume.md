## Professional Experience
### Zymergen, Inc.
**Data Analytics Intern** | May 2020 - December 2020

At Zymergen, I primarily developed and automated ETL pipelines using Apache Spark, connecting business applications like NetSuite and Coupa to our Snowflake data warehouse. I collaborated with stakeholders across teams to develop complex data integrations allowing for the automation of previously manual reporting. I also worked with Tableau to optimize data sources and create dashboards, one of which I presented to multiple executives. Additionally, I implemented a new ETL audit strategy to capture statistics and rows processed for 95+ batch jobs run daily.

### UC Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society
**Curriculum Developer** | February 2018 - August 2020

As a curriculum developer I developed short programming assignments tailored toward students without prior programming experience taking non-data science courses. Several courses I worked on included a [Sociology](https://github.com/ds-modules/SOC-5-Fall19) course, a [Global Studies](https://github.com/ds-modules/IAS-150) course, and a [Cognitive Science](https://github.com/ds-modules/COGSCI-1) course. I presented developed materials to students and explained basic data science concepts and the domain relevance. As a Float Developer from January 2020 onwards, I acted as an extra resource between teams, contributing to multiple courses as well as a project for the [UC Berkeley Library](https://github.com/ds-modules/Library).

### The Broad Center
**Summer Associate, Data, Research, and Evaluation** | June 2019 - August 2019

At TBC, I created a series of R scripts to process 100,000+ rows per year of student enrollment and graduation rate data from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/). I implemented a new custom Salesforce object to effectively store and display this data for 800+ school systems across 7 years, reducing time spent on a previously repetitive  process of school system research.

### SPUR
**Research Intern** | January 2019 - August 2019

Along with a team of 4 other students, I developed Python scripts to query the Bing Maps API for information on the time and length of driving and transit commutes for individuals working in San Francisco. Commute start and end points were obtained from US Census data. Created a dataset of 800,000+ commutes for comparing the time and cost effectiveness of transportation modes to inform policy research and action.

## Other Work
### Cal Athletics
**Student Worker** | November 2017 - Present

Since my Freshman year at UC Berkeley, I've worked with the athletic department to set up and break down home sporting events, including basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics. I've done many things from setting up basketball hoops, fetching balls during a volleyball match, keeping time during a gymnastics meet, and raising nets at football games.
