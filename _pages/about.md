I grew up in Palos Verdes, CA and currently attend UC Berkeley, where I'm double majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science.

I'm interested in the intersection of data science and social good, particularly in the areas of education and sustainability. I have previously worked at [Zymergen](/resume#zymergen-inc) as a Data Analytics Intern, and [The Broad Center](/resume#the-broad-center) as a Summer Associate on the Data, Research, and Evaluation team, along with various other work with the [UC Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](/resume#uc-berkeley-division-of-computing-data-science-and-society), [SPUR](/resume#spur), and [UC Berkeley Intercollegiate Athletics](/resume#uc-berkeley-intercollegiate-athletics).

In my free time, I enjoy playing with my dog, listening to [audiobooks](https://www.goodreads.com/kyuzuki), watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/keilyn/), and going for a [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/keilyn) or hike to get my 10,000 steps a day. Occasionally I'll go [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/) or attempt escape rooms with my family.

And, what's a mention of my dog without the appropriate dog tax? Here's Kinako, or Nako for short. She's a 13 year old shiba inu who enjoys sleeping all day and walking away from you when you tell her to come.
