I grew up in Palos Verdes, CA and currently attend UC Berkeley, where I'm double majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science.

I'm interested in the intersection of data science and social good, particularly in the areas of education and sustainability. I have previously worked at [Zymergen](https://www.zymergen.com/) as a Data Analytics Intern, and [The Broad Center](https://www.broadcenter.org/) as a Summer Associate on the Data, Research, and Evaluation team.

I consider myself to be an avid reader and audiobook [enthusiast](https://www.goodreads.com/kyuzuki), a mediocre [film critic](https://letterboxd.com/keilyn/), and an [amateur runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/keilyn).

In my free time, I enjoy playing with my dog, trying new recipes, curating my Spotify playlists, and going for a run or hike to get my 10,000 steps a day.

And, what's a mention of my dog without the appropriate dog tax? Here's Kinako, or Nako for short. She's a 13 year old shiba inu who enjoys sleeping all day and walking away from you when you tell her to come.
